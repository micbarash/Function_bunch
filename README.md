# Function_bunch
A bunch of small, somewhat useful functions:

- repeatString() : Takes a string as input and a number as an argument. Returns the input string multiplied by the argument.

- reverseString() : Takes a string as input, returns the same string reversed.

- removeFromArray(): Takes an array as input, and a second array as an argument. Removes items from the array if they exist in the argument.

- sumAll() : Takes 2 integers and returns the sum of every number between (and including) them.

- leapYear(): Determines whether or not a given year is a leap year.

- tempConversion(): Convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius (and the other way around).
